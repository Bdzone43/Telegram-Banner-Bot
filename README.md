## Creating a Telegram Bot

To create a Telegram bot, you will need to follow these steps:

1. Open the Telegram app and search for the "BotFather" bot.
2. Start a chat with the BotFather by clicking on the "Start" button.
3. Send the command `/newbot` to create a new bot.
4. Choose a name for your bot (e.g., "My Banner Bot").
5. Choose a unique username for your bot, ending with the word "bot" (e.g., "mybanner_bot").
6. After successfully creating your bot, BotFather will provide you with a bot token. Make sure to save this token, as you will need it later.

## Replacing the Bot Token

To replace the bot token with your own, follow these steps:

1. Open the Python script file named `telegram_banner_bot.py`.
2. Locate the line that says `YOUR_BOT_TOKEN = 'YOUR-BOT-TOKEN-HERE'`.
3. Replace the placeholder text `'YOUR-BOT-TOKEN-HERE'` with the bot token you received from the BotFather.
4. Save the changes to the file.

```python
# Replace this line in telegram_banner_bot.py
YOUR_BOT_TOKEN = 'YOUR-BOT-TOKEN-HERE'
# With your actual bot token
YOUR_BOT_TOKEN = '1234567890:ABCdefGhiJKlmnopQRStuVwxyz'
```

## How to Use the Banner Bot

1. Install the required Python libraries by running the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Start the bot by running the following command:

```python
python Banner_bot.py
```

3. Add your bot to a Telegram group or start a chat with it.

4. Send commands and messages to your bot to generate and display custom banners.

For example:

    /addbuttons Hello, World!: Generates a banner with the text "Hello, World!".
	
	Usage: /addbuttons <text1> <URL1> <text2> <URL2> 
	
	Just Forward a message Ensure that it looks like this
